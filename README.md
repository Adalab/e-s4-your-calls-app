## Project summary: “Your Calls”

Yours Calls is a web app that allows Interacso employees to register calls and send automatic notifications with the registered call data through Slack to the person requested.

### Project objectives:

1. Create a system to register incoming calls data in a fast way (who calls, their contact details, person requested, message...)

2. Send the info automatically to the recipients (requested Interacso employees).

3. Check the calls history.
